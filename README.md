# ITAPI3 - Managed TAPI 3.0 .NET wrapper

This C++/CLI library is for applications that want to access TAPI 3.x functions.  The existing .NET RCW cannot be used with TAPI 3.0 due to some issues in the TAPI 3.0 COM library. This wrapper works around those issues and provides a proper wrapped implementation.

The last build of this code was with Visual Studio 2008 using the C++/CLI compiler.

If you are interested in using TAPI 2.0, then check out [ATAPI](https://github.com/markjulmar/atapi/)instead.
